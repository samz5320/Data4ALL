☆ Block pop ups, ads, and annoying banners (even remove video ads!) on YouTube, Facebook, Twitch, and all your favorite sites

ABOUT
 
Download AdBlock’s free ad blocker to block ads everywhere on the web. AdBlock also protects your browser from malware and stops advertisers from accessing your browsing history and personal information.

AdBlock for Chrome works automatically. Just click ""Add to Chrome,"" then visit your favorite website and see the ads disappear! Choose to continue seeing unobtrusive ads, whitelist your favorite sites, or block all ads by default.

AdBlock participates in the Acceptable Ads program, so unobtrusive ads are not blocked by default in order to support websites. We believe users should control what they see on the web, so you can easily opt out in AdBlock’s settings.

==============================
USER REVIEWS

Almira Tamar - ★★★★★
“Have used it for god knows how long. By far the best adblock i've ever used.”

Jo MR - ★★★★★
“Works awesome even with the free version, so I'm even happier to support them. AdBlock has made my work so much easier for years. I especially like the ""pictures"" features, where instead of ads I get to see cats, and nature, and puppies. Works really well on all sites, it's easy to customize and it provides a safer navigation experience. Why should we get bombed with ads everywhere? It's exhausting. 
Thanks AdBlock Team!

Noam Hadad - ★★★★★
“BEST ad block for chrome, it blocks so many ads. A world without ads finally!!”

Jerome Mitchell - ★★★★★
“Blocks all ads, and also handy that you can whitelist websites that do not allow adblockers.”

Quinch - ★★★★★
“I have been using this for so long. It does what it should do and is very friendly. Never have to skip ads on YouTube anymore.”

Edd White - ★★★★★
“The best adblocker!”

Arik Akon - ★★★★★
“I Downloaded a few adblockers, to see which was best. i left it for a month when i came to check on it. So far, the others have done nearly a few thousand, like 2000 ads blocked so far. But this one reaches 11 000! Absolutely suggest this above all!”

Blocks ads on Facebook, YouTube and all other websites.",7816696,4.7,50049,"November 27, 2020",Productivity,Offered by: adguard.com,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/drNKxHkz1ooib4IDUeY1xm5wCvp_8anj18TVqHinu0RhuXSwy19OPEV0TXYJHmoJ8aP77weyDA=w128-h128-e365-rj-sc0x00ffffff,"AdGuard ad blocker effectively blocks all types of ads on all web pages, even on Facebook, YouTube and others!

## What AdGuard ad blocker does:

★ Blocks all ads: video ads (includes YouTube adblock), rich media advertising, unwanted pop-ups, banners and text ads (includes Facebook adblock);
★ Speeds up page loading and saves bandwidth, thanks to the missing ads and pop-up windows;
★ Protects your privacy by blocking common third-party tracking systems;
★ Blocks many spyware, adware, and dialer installers;
★ Protects you from malware and phishing.

## What are the advantages of AdGuard over Adblock or Adblock Plus?

★ AdGuard ad blocker is really fast and lightweight. It uses half as much memory as other popular solutions: Adblock, Adblock Plus, and even outperforms uBlock Adblocker in some tests;
★ AdGuard can handle most of the adblock circumvention scripts;
★ AdGuard is simply better looking and modern (in our opinion).

## How can AdGuard ad blocker protect your privacy?

Privacy protection is one of the main goals! Just enable the ""AdGuard Tracking Protection filter"" in AdGuard settings. It completely removes all forms of tracking from the Internet. AdGuard has one of the largest tracker filter lists containing more than 10,000 rules. It is even larger than the databases of Ghostery® and Disconnect.

## How to remove social media widgets with AdGuard?

Tired of all the «Like» buttons and similar widgets infesting all of your frequented web pages? Just enable AdGuard ""Social media filter"" and forget about them.

## How can AdGuard ad blocker protect you from online threats?

At the moment we’ve got more than 2,000,000 harmful websites on record. AdGuard can block domains known to spread malware, protecting your computer against viruses, Trojan horses, worms, spyware, and adware. AdGuard really lowers the risk of virus infections and prohibits access to harmful websites to prevent potential attacks.

## Crypto-jacking protection

We did comprehensive research on crypto-jacking and, as a result, AdGuard can reliably block most of the known crypto-jackers including CoinHive. You can also add some open source filters like NoCoin which will give you an additional layer of protection.

## Why does AdGuard require permissions?

* ""Access your data for all websites"" and ""Access browser tabs"": both permissions are necessary for AdGuard to apply all kinds of cosmetic processing to the pages' content. Naive ad blocking would simply block ad servers, and leave broken elements and first-party ads on the pages. AdGuard applies special cosmetic rules to make pages look clean and tidy.
* ""Access browser activity during navigation"": this permission is necessary to keep track of navigation events in order to apply rules when the time is right.

This started as a Google-sponsored (“By Google”) extension in 2010 when Chrome was introducing its extensions platform:
http://chrome.blogspot.com/2010/11/new-chrome-extensions-by-google.html

NOTE: THIS IS NOT A GOOGLE PRODUCT.

This is NOT a Google-sponsored product although the primary author works at Google. Although I wrote this extension (over 10 years ago), I have not been maintaining it in my capacity as a Googler for a long time now. This extension is not officially supported by any Google team, and does not have the “By Google” designation any more. It is also not subject to any Google security or privacy policies, so please do not equate its Googler authorship with Google endorsement.

It is an open source project whose original author happens to be a Googler. I may consider giving it up to a willing maintainer at some point, well outside the purview of any Google policies.",,[Contact the developer](mailto:manas@tungare.name)
